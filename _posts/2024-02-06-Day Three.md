### Day three

**Time spent:** 43:13  
**Milestones reached:** Completed 'Learn Responsive Web Design by Building a Piano' module and 'Technical Documentation Page' project

**Interesting learnings:**  

* Setting a property value to ‘inherit’ tells the target to use the same value as its parent
* Pseudo-elements can follow a target, and allow the creation of an element before/after each target
  * ```::before```
  * ```::after```
* ```float``` property tells an element where in its container to 'float' to
* You can string together selectors
    - i.e ```stadium.seat::before``` creats a pseudo element before every seat in the stadium
* The @ media rule is used for conditional CSS
    * ```@media(property: value) { }```
    * Can be combined conditions with ```and``` keyword
* ```overflow: hidden``` ensures the wrapping of an item isn’t shown (i.e if the screen width is too small)
* You can make an anchor link to a section by using a ```<a> ```tag and setting the ```href=”#id_to_jump_to”```
