### Day two

**Time spent:** 1:02:45
**Milestones reached:** Completed 'Learn Intermediate CSS by Building a Cat Painting' module  

**Interesting learnings:**  

* Types of positioning: 
  - ```static``` (doesnâ€™t care about top, left etc.)
  - ```relative``` (relative to 'normal' position)
  - ```absolute``` (relative to nearest ancestor)
  - ```sticky``` (toggles between ```relative``` and ```fixed``` based on scroll position)
  - ```fixed``` (relative to viewport - always stays in same position while scrolling)

* The ```transform``` attribute: 
  - ```translate()```
  - ```rotate()```
  - ```scale()```
  - ```skew()```
  - ```matrix()```
