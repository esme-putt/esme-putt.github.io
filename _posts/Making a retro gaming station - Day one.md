## Making a retro gaming system - day one

I have three problems:
1. Although I am a software developer, I know very little about computer hardware
2. I am forever trapped in nostalgia
3. I am going to Japan in three months and want to save all of my money for the trip

The symptoms of my current nostalgia include scouring Facebook Marketplace for retro handheld gaming systems and original Pok√©mon games, opening listings, typing messages to sellers, then remembering problem #3 - I want to spend as little money as possible in the next three months.
