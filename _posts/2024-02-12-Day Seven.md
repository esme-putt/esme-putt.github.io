### Day seven

**Time spent:** 1:00:44  
**Milestones reached:** Worked on 'Learn CSS Transforms by Building a Penguin' module

**Interesting learnings:**  

* ```transform: skew(x-axis, y-axis)```
* ```opacity: value``` can be used to change only the alpha of an object   
 
* Reminders:
    * Setting the position element of a target to absolute prevents it from taking up space in the page (i.e pushing other elements away)
    * To select all descendants of an object, use the object and ```*``` (i.e ```body * { }```)
    * Use ```overflow: hidden``` to remove all scroll bars
