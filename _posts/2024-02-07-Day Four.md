### Day four

**Time spent:** 47:20  
**Milestones reached:** Worked on 'Learn CSS Variables by Building a City Skyline' module

**Interesting learnings:**  

* CSS variables
  * Declared by writing ```--variable-name: value;``` within a target
  * To use the variable write ```var(--variable-name)```
  * Variables can only be used in the element they are declared in, and elements that are contained within that element (child elements)
      * To get around this, declare global variables in the ```:root``` target
