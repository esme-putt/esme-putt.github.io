## 100 days of code

In my [100 days of code](https://www.100daysofcode.com/), I intend to complete five of the certifications on [freecodecamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).
In total, it is 60 modules, and I have completed 10 of them. That conveniently leaves 50 to complete in 100 days. 

I am relying on a good amount of the information being somewhat familiar - but am committed to the course format to plug the gaps I have in my knowlege.

I will also be diving into side projects as they pop up, and learning other new things along the way. 

Each day I will report back on what I have been doing, and anything interesting I have learnt. I will be tracking
the time I spend on the challenge each day using [Clockify](https://clockify.me/).
