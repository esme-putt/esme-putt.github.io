### Day one

**Time spent:** 1:42:57  
**Milestones reached:** Completed 'Learn more about Pseudo Selectors by Building a Balance Sheet' module  

**Interesting learnings:**  

* It can be hard to centre things in CSS (there isn't a lack of ways to get it done - it's just hard to remember which to do!)  
  * Consider all of these ways to center different elements in different contexts:
     * ```text-align: center```  
     * ```align: center```  
     * ```display: block, margin-left: auto, margin-right: auto```  
     * ```display: flex, justify-content: center```  
     * ```margin: auto```  
     * ```horizontal-align: center```  

 * You can use html attributes to assign a hot/access key to things like buttons
     * ```accesskey="a"```  
  
 * For accessibility, it is best practice to write html in an order that makes sense for the screen reader - you can change the placement of things using CSS
   * For example, captions should always be the first item nested in a table element (but can also be repositioned with CSS, using the ```caption-side``` property).

 * The different tags that can be used to create tables
   * ```thead```  
   * ```tbody```  
   * ```tr```  
   * ```td```  
   * ```th```  
  
 * Different selectors can be used to target more specific parts of html
   * ```p[class=”myClass”]``` (targets elements that include that class in their class-list)  
   * ```p.myClass (targets``` elements whose only class is that class)  
   * ```p.myClass:hover``` (targets state)
   * ```p.myClass:nth-of-type/last-of-type``` (targets specific items)
     
 * This one line I ALWAYS have to Google to remember:
   * ```<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />```
